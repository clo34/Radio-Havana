# AM Radio Signal Demodulation using MATLAB

## Introduction

The objective of this lab is to use MATLAB to demodulate real AM radio signals. In particular, we'll demodulate and listen to a number of radio stations that broadcast around the frequency of 6.0 MHz. Because of the propagation characteristics of radio waves at these frequencies, a single location in the U.S. can pick up stations from around the world. To learn more, check out [Shortwave radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio).

## Overview

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. An AM radio signal is generated by multiplying an audio signal with a sine wave. If \( a(t) \) is the audio signal, then the signal transmitted by the radio station is:

\[ x_T(t) = a(t) \cos(2\pi f_1 t) \]

where \( f_1 \) is the carrier frequency of the radio station. One of the stations weâ€™ll listen to in this lab is Radio Havana, transmitted out of Havana, Cuba. Radio Havana uses \( f_1 = 6.0 \) MHz. The maximum frequency component in \( a(t) \) is 5 kHz, which means the radio station occupies frequencies from about 5995 kHz to 6005 kHz.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later
